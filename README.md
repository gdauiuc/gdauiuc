### Hi there 👋


**gdauiuc** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because here is where we start.

Here are some ideas to get you started:
- We will have three general tasks :

  a. Project
  
  b. Course
  
  c. Job searching 


## Your weekly checkbox :
 
✔️  Write down your weekly plan and update it when you are done ( Before meeting )

✔️  Update it on GitHub under your name folder ( Before meeting )
